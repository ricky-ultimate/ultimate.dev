            <p>
                Hello! I’m Ricky, a 3rd-year Computer Science undergraduate and a passionate developer with a knack for both full stack web and desktop development. With three years of hands-on coding experience, I thrive on building innovative and efficient solutions that make a difference.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an INFJ, I bring a unique blend of creativity and introspection to my work. My love for cryptography fuels my curiosity about secure communication and the art of encoding secrets, while my fascination with psychology helps me understand user behavior and create intuitive interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me immersed in the world of manga, where I draw inspiration from compelling stories and dynamic characters. I also dabble in a bit of Japanese—just enough to appreciate the nuances of my favorite manga in their original language!
            </p>
            <p>
                This blend of interests shapes my approach to technology and design, driving me to craft solutions that are not only functional but also engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to explore my work and connect with me. Let’s build something amazing together!
